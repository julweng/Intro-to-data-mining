Data mining for scientific applications
lecture 1 notes

data explosion
-automated data collection tools and mature database technology lead to  tremendous amounts of data stored in databases, data warehouses and other  information repositories
-we are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge

solution
-data mining: extraction of interesting knowledge (rules, regularities, patterns, constraints) from data in large databases

why data mining:
-huge amounts of data
-electronic records of our decisions:
    -choices in the supermarket
    -financial records
    -our comings and goings
    -electronic health records
    -genetic data
-we swipe our way through the world-every swipe is a record in a database
-data rich, but information poor
-lying hidden in all this data is information!

data vs information
-society produces massive amounts of data: business, science, medicine, economics, sports,...
-potentially valuable resource
-raw data is useless:
    -need techniques to automatically extract information
    -data: recorded facts
    -information: pattens underlying the data

Information is crucial
example 1: in vitro fertilization
given: embryos described by 60 features
problem: selection of embryos that will survive
data: historical records of embryos and outcome

example 2: cow culling
given: cows described by 700 features
problem: selection of cows that should be bulled
data: historical records and farmers' decisions

what is data mining
-extracting or "mining" knowledge from large amounts of data
-data-driven discovery and modeling of hidden patterns (we never knew existed) in large volumes of data
-extraction of implicit, previously unknown and unexpected, potentially useful information from data

definitions of data mining:
-extraction of interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) information or patterns from data in large databases

data mining is NOT:
-data warehousing
-deductive query processing: SQL/reporting
-software agents
-expert systems
-online analytical processing (OLAP)
-statistical analysis tool
-data visualization

data mining IS:
-programs that detect patterns and rules in the data
-strong patterns can be used to make non-trivial predictions on new data

data mining challenges:
1. most patterns are not interesting-we need to find subsets of patterns that are interesting
2. patterns may be inexact or completely spurious when noisy data present

How do we get around these two problems:
Machine learning techniques:
1 technical basis for data mining: algorithms for acquiring structural descriptions from examples
2 methods originate from artificial intelligence, statistics, and research on databases
3. structural descriptions represent patterns explicitly can be used to
    -predict outcome in new situations
    -understand and explain how prediction is derived (maybe even more important)

Multidisciplinary Field of data mining:
database technology, statistics, machine learning, visualization, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, knowledge-based systems/acquisition, high performance computing, other disciplines

History of data mining
-emerged 1980s, flourished in 1990s
-roots traced back along three family lines:
    -classical statistics
    -artificial intelligence
    -machine learning

Statistics
-foundation of most DM technologies
    -regression analysis, standard distribution/deviation/variance, cluster analysis, confidence intervals
    -building blocks
    -significant role in today's data mining-but alone is not powerful enough

Artificial Intelligence
-heuristics vs statistics
-human-thought-like processing
-requires vast computer processing power
-supercomputers

Machine learning
-Union of statistics and AI
    -blends AI heuristics with advanced statistical analysis
-let computer programs:
    -learn about data they study-make different decisions based on the quality of studied data
    -using statistics for fundamental concepts and adding more advanced AI heuristics and algorithms

Data mining
-adoption of the machin learning techniques to the real world problems
-union: statistics, AI, machine learning
-used to find previously hidden trends or patterns
-finding increasing acceptance in science and business areas which need to analyze large amounts of data to discover trends which could not be found otherwise

Terminology
-gold mining
-knowledge mining from databases
-knowledge extraction
-data/pattern analysis
-knowledge discovery databases or KDD
-information harvesting
-business intelligence

KDD process:
database -> selection, transformation -> data preparation -> training data ->
data mining -> model, patterns -> evaluation, verification:
    -> training data
    -> data preparation
    -> selection, transformation

steps of a KDD process
-learning the application domain:
    -relevant prior knowledge and goals of application
-creating a target data set: data selection
-data cleaning and preprocessing: may take 60% of effort
-data reduction and transformation:
    -find useful features, dimensionality/variable reduction, representation
-choosing functions of data mining
    -summarization, classification, regression, association, clustering
-choosing the mining algorithm(s)
-data mining: search for patterns of interest
-pattern evaluation and knowledge presentation
    -visualization, transformation, removing redundant patterns, etc.
-use and integration of discovered knowledge

learning algorithms
fundamental idea:
learn rules/patterns/relationships automatically from data

data mining tasks
-exploratory data analysis
-predictive modeling: classification and regression
-descriptive modeling
    -cluster analysis/segmentation
-discovering patterns and rules
    -association/dependency rules
    -sequential patterns
    -temporal sequences
-deviation detection (e.g. credit card fraud)

data mining tasks
-concept/class description: characterization and discrimination
    -generalize, summarize, and contrast data characteristics, e.g. dry vs. wet regions
-association: correlation and causality
    -multi-dimensional or single-dimensional association,
        e.g. age (X, "20-20")^income(X, "60-90K") -> buys(X, "TV")

data mining tasks
classification and prediction:
-finding models(functions) that describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction
-example: classify countries based on climate, or classify cars based on gas mileage
-when we predict values that are numerical, these are numerical predictions
-when we predict values that are nominal, these are classification
-presentation:
    -if-THEN rules, decision-tree, classification rule, neural network
-prediction: predict some unknown or missing numerical values

cluster analysis
-class label is unknown: group data to form new classes
    example: cluster houses to find distribution patterns
-clustering based on the principle: maximizing the intra-class similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity

Outlier analysis
outlier: a data object that does not comply wiht the general behavior of the data
-mostly considered as noise or exception, but is quite useful in fraud detection, rare events analysis

trend and evolution analysis
-trend and deviation: regression analysis
-sequential pattern mining, periodicity analysis

Taxonomy
-predictive methods
    -use some variables to predict some unknown or future values of other variables
-descriptive methods
    -find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data
-supervised vs. unsupervised
    -labeled vs. unlabeled data
-example data sets:
    -weka book page 9/11: the weather data set
    -weka book page 15/16: the CPU performance data

CRISP-DM methodology
cross-industry standard process for data mining
6 phases:
1. business understanding
2. data understanding
3. data preparation
4. modeling
5. evaluation
6. deployment

data mining challenges
-computation expensive to investigate all possibilities
-dealing with noise/missing information and errors in data
-choosing appropriate attributes/input representation
-finding the minimal attribute space
-finding adequate evaluation function(s)
-extracting meaningful information
-not overfitting

are all the discovered patterns interesting?
interestingness measures: a pattern in interesting if it is easily understood by humans, valid on new or test data with some degree of certainty, potentially useful, novel, or validates some hypothesis that a user seeks to confirm

objective vs. subjective measures:
objective: based on statistics and structures of patterns
    -support and confidence
subjective: based on user's belief in the data
    -unexpectedness, novelty, action ability, etc.

completeness-find ALL the interesting patterns
    -can a data mining system find ALL the interesting patterns?
    -association vs classification vs. clustering have different ways of finding interesting patterns

can we find all and only interesting patterns?
-optimization - search for only interesting patterns
    -can a data mining system find only the interesting patterns?
